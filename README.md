# RF signal detection using machine learning project

In this project we built a machine learning model capable of classifying various wireless signals.
Unlike other papers that have been written on this subject, we apply real world signals that we
found in the RF (radio frequency) space and that were collected off an SDR (software defined
radio). Other papers often simulated data of simple and distinct modulation, which have no
noise or other signals present in the data. In the real world, the RF space is often very crowded
in certain bands and has many complexities, such as RF noise and interference such as
multipathing. Our results show that we were able to classify signals with a 92.5% accuracy using
a CNN.
